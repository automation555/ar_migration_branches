Description:
    The migration_branch generator creates a stub for a new database migration 
    in the specified branch.

    The generator takes a migration name as its argument.  The migration name 
    may be given in CamelCase or under_score.

    The generator creates a migration class in db/migrate/<branch> 
    prefixed by its number in the queue.

Syntax:
    ./script/generate migration_branches migration_name branch_name [migration_name[:branch_name] [...]]

Example:
    > ./script/generate migration_branches create_sessions
    Creates the migration: 
        db/migrate/XXX_create_sessions.rb
    
    > ./script/generate migration_branches create_users users user_preferences:users
    Creates the migration: 
        db/migrate/users/001_create_users.rb
        db/migrate/users/001_create_user_preferences.rb
    
    > ./script/generate migration_branches create_states lookup create_address_types:lookup
    Creates the migrations (and directory if doesn't exist):
    db/migrate/lookup/001_create_states.rb
    db/migrate/lookup/002_create_address_types.rb
