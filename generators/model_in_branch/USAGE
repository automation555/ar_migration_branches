Description:
    The model_in_branch generator creates stubs for a new model in a given branch.

    The generator takes a model name and a branch name as its arguments.  
    The model name may be given in CamelCase or under_score and should not be suffixed with 'Model'.

    As additional parameters, the generator will take attribute pairs described by name and type. These attributes will
    be used to prepopulate the migration to create the table for the model and give you a set of predefined fixture.    
    You don't have to think up all attributes up front, but it's a good idea of adding just the baseline of what's 
    needed to start really working with the resource.

    The generator creates a model class in app/models, a test suite in test/unit, test fixtures in
    test/fixtures/singular_name.yml, and a migration in db/migrate.

Examples:
    ./script/generate model_in_branch account company

        This will create an Account model:
            Model:      app/models/account.rb
            Test:       test/unit/account_test.rb
            Fixtures:   test/fixtures/accounts.yml
            Migration:  db/migrate/company/XXX_add_accounts.rb

    ./script/generate model_in_branch post blog title:string created_on:date body:text published:boolean
    
        Creates post model in blog branch with predefined attributes.
